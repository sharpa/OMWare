# CodeWriter
# This module provides [will provide] encapsulation for platform specific code writing
# For example, I may want to run my assembly in serial on my Windows laptop (not a great idea),
# or I may want to run it in serial on a specific flavor of linux based cluster (more likely).
# It's not the job of the optical map assembly to keep track of OS specifications

# Step
# This module encapsulates and abstractifies a single part of any operation workflow
