# Common, miscellaneous scripts for optical map manipulation

# CodeWriter
# This module provides [will provide] encapsulation for platform specific code writing
# For example, I may want to run my assembly in serial on my Windows laptop (not a great idea),
# or I may want to run it in serial on a specific flavor of linux based cluster (more likely).
# It's not the job of the optical map assembly to keep track of OS specifications

# Resources
# Similar to code writer above, many assembly algorithms are sensitive to hardware availabilities,
# such as maximum memory or threads

# Wizard
# I'm envisioning a sort of question and answer command line interface experience that will allow
# new users to choose input parameter values with confidence.  It will include helpful hints.
