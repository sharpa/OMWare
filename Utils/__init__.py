# Common, miscellaneous scripts for optical map manipulation

# Resources
# Similar to code writer above, many assembly algorithms are sensitive to hardware availabilities,
# such as maximum memory or threads

# Wizard
# I'm envisioning a sort of question and answer command line interface experience that will allow
# new users to choose input parameter values with confidence.  It will include helpful hints.

# CD
# Every "step" has a working directory that is separate from the code directory.  This class
# encapsulates the process of changing directories, and is very careful to change back once complete

# Workspace
# Encapsulates information that every code-generator needs to know, and can only get from the outside
# For example, executables, work dirs, and input datasets
